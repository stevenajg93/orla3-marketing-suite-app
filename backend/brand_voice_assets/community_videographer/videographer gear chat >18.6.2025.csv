The magic arm SHOULD be strong enough by its own but ofc the force acting on the lever arm is crazy here since it holds the gimbal from the back . Reversing the monitor mount and the magic arm should give it a better chance to not break. Also unscrewing the rod plate and placing it on the middle.,,

333909848762744832,potiii,2024-05-18T11:59:24.3090000+01:00,What I do is push the can against the Right arm of the gimbal before I balance it so it is 100% the same orientation when i attach the plate ( u still balance it but the right arm is fixed and U will never have to worry about attaching the plate 1mm left or right compared to the previous use .,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2024-05-18T11:59:29.0810000+01:00,You can mark it as well,,

333909848762744832,potiii,2024-05-18T11:59:59.2610000+01:00,So once u balanced it you dont have to rebalance unless u add weight or change lenses ofc,,

 The R50 works as USB webcam, the R10 needs a capture card or Canon's EOS Webcam Utility to use as a webcam.
 

 The R50 doesn't have a full-mechanical shutter option like the R10, but electronic first-curtain works just as well 99% of the time.
 

 The R10's burst rate is slightly faster, 15/23 vs 12/15 FPS on the R50. More importantly its buffer is also significantly larger, and clears faster as the R10 is compatible with UHS-II SD cards.
 

 The R10 has a 5-pin hotshoe for older Canon speedlite models, to use them on the R50 you'd need the AD-E1 adapter.",,

 The one, that is the most inconspicous of them all is the PicoMic, because it's microphone is in the clip. The body goes behind your shirt collar.
 It also has the longest battery run time in one go: 20 hours.
 And it can take a lav.
 What it doesn't have: it's not a bluetooth mic and it's receiver doesn't have a USB audio interface.
 The InstaMic is the only of the 4 that can do timecode ... and is waterproof. Timecode it needs, as it can't be directly connected to most cameras. It's either a 32-bit float recorder or a bluetooth mic.
 I forgot the Wireless Pro set in the office .. but most of us know how much bigger that is.",,

I'm pretty much just ""a guy"" - I am not a techie, I didn't even know what he was talking about. I got the FX30 because I'm a film-maker - My natural instinct is cinematic ratios like 16:9 and 1.88 so I bought a camera that would do that. And though I have not yet shot anything but a few interviews with it, I'm loving the 4K quality and am very happy with the video clips.

721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:52:08.7490000+00:00,DJI have never had any bluetooth support .. for any Lumix cameras,,

719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:52:30.8760000+00:00,meanwhile u can wirelessly control focus on any sony camera thru bluetooth XD,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:52:44.1410000+00:00,evn if its delayed a bit,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:53:03.2970000+00:00,Meanwhile you can do auto-tracking and DJI Lidar can control the internal AF of your Lumix lenses ...,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:53:06.5710000+00:00,which you can't on Sony,,

721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:53:17.7410000+00:00,just requires the cable,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:53:19.2260000+00:00,no,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:53:21.1100000+00:00,Lumix only,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:53:23.5830000+00:00,lool,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:53:35.1260000+00:00,well at least we have that,,

719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:53:59.3110000+00:00,but getting a lidar is a bit of a waste imo if u dont own any anamorphic or manual only lenses,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:54:12.0210000+00:00,you don't need the Lidar for active track,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:55:02.7000000+00:00,if your Lumix camera is supported .. and the S5D and S5-II are .. then your Lumix camera delivers the video feed to the gimbal via the USB cable.,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:55:31.8230000+00:00,i see,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:55:33.7570000+00:00,OG S5 is also supported for active track,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:56:59.4540000+00:00,imagine if they release s5 iii that rivals A 7S III spec wise,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:57:20.9580000+00:00,would kill for a lumix camera with 120fps 4k no crop afc,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:57:54.2630000+00:00,The S5 is not in that space.,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:58:06.5650000+00:00,That's the market of the S1H,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:58:14.7200000+00:00,u think so ?,,
177933684173701120,doublejjared,2025-01-04T22:58:57.2340000+00:00,yeah no shot that comes to an s5,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T22:59:11.1990000+00:00,"The S5-II competes with the A7IV, Canon EOS R6 Mk II and Nikon Z6 III

177933684173701120,doublejjared,2025-01-04T22:59:17.2060000+00:00,they would essentially be telling people to not buy their higher end stuff,,
177933684173701120,doublejjared,2025-01-04T22:59:36.2940000+00:00,at least not any time soon,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T22:59:36.4400000+00:00,fair point,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:00:36.7070000+00:00,The S1H is the next one to be update. It's basically the full frame variant of the GH7,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:00:51.1660000+00:00,so we'll get the new AF and likely ProRes RAW recording in camera,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T23:01:22.2830000+00:00,is the s1h bigger than s5ii ?,,
177933684173701120,doublejjared,2025-01-04T23:01:29.3080000+00:00,yeah i need lumix to make an fx3 killer so i can get it,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T23:01:30.2570000+00:00,size wise,,
177933684173701120,doublejjared,2025-01-04T23:01:37.9210000+00:00,lol,,
719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T23:02:01.1320000+00:00,cuz i feel like it's physically possible to put those specs in a s5ii body,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:02:23.6510000+00:00,"it's a higher end model. Sizewise, it's not much bigger, I think.",,

721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:03:19.6670000+00:00,and the GH7 is sort of a FX30 killer,,

719867461532647435,lowsoft,2025-01-04T23:04:23.0590000+00:00,if s1h mark 2 drops it's def gonna rival with s7 iii,,
177933684173701120,doublejjared,2025-01-04T23:05:06.5490000+00:00,and then boom a7s4,,

721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:05:44.7610000+00:00,like their top notch ones,,
177933684173701120,doublejjared,2025-01-04T23:06:38.9530000+00:00,idk whats going to happen but i think the next 2 years ill just save money and i think there is going to be quite a few nice releases in 2025,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:06:52.5130000+00:00,"resolution and fps, the S5-II X is on par with the S1H. So I figure, they'll up the spec on the Mk 2 S1H",,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:07:39.2360000+00:00,haha . 2024 was a blowout ... hell the last 3 years have been.,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:07:59.2490000+00:00,Lumix finally moving into phase detect AF and adding internal RAW recording was big.,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:08:14.4480000+00:00,Canon has just introduced tripple base ISO to their Cine line cameras,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:08:31.3910000+00:00,and lens releases have been epic.,,
177933684173701120,doublejjared,2025-01-04T23:09:29.3050000+00:00,yeah im curious if nikon may try and release a box style cinema camera or if sony may bring global shutter to lower end models unlikely but just curious,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:09:35.2300000+00:00,oh .. Lumix also added 32-bit float recording this year .. to their cameras.,,
177933684173701120,doublejjared,2025-01-04T23:09:45.4010000+00:00,yeah i saw that,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:09:54.2680000+00:00,unlikely .... as they now own RED,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:09:59.7390000+00:00,they have all the box cameras they need,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-04T23:10:34.5500000+00:00,they might add another model of RED with Nikon Z-mount though,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T10:10:16.5610000+00:00,Im waiting for a lumix box cam,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T10:10:28.5730000+00:00,That would be very interesting,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T10:57:44.5930000+00:00,They exist. BGH-1 and BS1H,,

 BS1H is based on the S1H",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:22:43.4000000+00:00,I know that one but i wasn‚Äôt really impressed w the performance based on the tests that iv seen,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:23:07.4320000+00:00,And also if im not mistaken it does not have opengate?,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:24:05.0930000+00:00,Oh it does ?,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:24:06.4720000+00:00,Hmmm,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:25:40.3780000+00:00,"nearly all Lumix are open gate. That's the big Lumix advantage.
 Those 2 cameras have all the features of the mirrorless cameras, that they're based on, minus the stills features.
 And then have more I/O added.",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:26:04.2390000+00:00,Because what i wanted to do is,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:26:11.9770000+00:00,"The only downside with them right now, is that they're not on the updated AF.",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:26:24.3460000+00:00,Adapt it to PL and use the anamorphic in a 90 degree rotation,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:26:40.1130000+00:00,To have a vertical squeeze,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:26:57.4440000+00:00,"Well, then the BS1H is perfect. It's also fully supported by DJI Focus Pro",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:27:00.8970000+00:00,"And w open gate that would give me even more vertical clearance,",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:27:44.6340000+00:00,"Ill have to look into this now, thankfullz at CvP u can book a slot to test out cameras, might do that to see how it performs",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:28:32.5230000+00:00,"But i mjght just grab the Bm micro studio that u have , u peaked my interest w that and since than iv checked out a million videos about it",,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:29:11.9690000+00:00,BMD have just updated the gyro data in that one with the latest firmware. It's now even more precise.,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:29:42.6530000+00:00,Oh. U know the small tilta hydra mini arm?,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:29:56.7740000+00:00,Its made for the dji action cam or the osmo pocket i think,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:30:17.3690000+00:00,I wanna mount the studio on it since,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:30:23.6770000+00:00,It can hold up to 600g,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:30:35.7360000+00:00,so in theory it should work w s light enough lens,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:31:23.0060000+00:00,"I have one from a different brand, that I bought before Tilta launched theirs. Not sure, if you'd be able to mount it, but the Micro Studio is a good chunk smaller than the Lumix cubes.",,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:31:26.0860000+00:00,For sure.,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:31:49.9310000+00:00,I have a picture somewhere.,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:31:54.9320000+00:00,"Yup i know, it was between this and the zve-10",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:31:59.1780000+00:00,To test this,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:32:11.4770000+00:00,But i lean towards the micro studio because,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:32:15.2030000+00:00,Bmd Raw,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:32:18.4810000+00:00,And sdi,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:32:39.4810000+00:00,The Lumix bricks can also do BRAW,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:32:41.4070000+00:00,over HDMI,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:32:44.0800000+00:00,both of them.,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:32:49.7950000+00:00,Yup iv seen it,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:32:52.9730000+00:00,Pro res as well,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:33:01.4130000+00:00,but .. and here's the kicker,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:33:12.8320000+00:00,"the Lumix cams are 4K on HDMI, but only 3G SDI",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:33:13.7980000+00:00,But i prefer BMD raw by 10 x over prores,,

333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:35:37.7330000+00:00,"Yup , thats what iv tought, i mean, probably wouldnt use an external monitor on it either way, a video transmitter is needed tho. But 1080p is enough imo, it would be used for strange unique angles and thats about it",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:36:06.2010000+00:00,"I just.. need to get some BMD raw footage from the pocket 6k and try to match it w the red , it should be a breeze",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:36:22.0480000+00:00,I know that the pocket 6k is not the same sensor as the micro studio,,

333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:37:22.3740000+00:00,So i can try to match that w the r3D raw,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:37:26.9750000+00:00,To see how it behaves,,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:37:50.6810000+00:00,"i mean, BRAW out of the BMPCC and the Micro Studio matches pretty well to Lumix and Canon",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-01-05T12:38:05.5380000+00:00,"And if it works well , than I think the micro should do fine as well. Obviously different sensor, less dr but it should be matchable",,
721686599317979136,marlow925,2025-01-05T12:38:06.5900000+00:00,I can't see there being a big issue matching it to RED,,

 1. FOTO R15 Single Axis Gimbal Stabilizer: 
  if you're using phone to record video, and you are low on budget, well, it's suitable for you. It's cheap, foldable and portable, easy to carry.
 

 2. APEXEL 18x Zoom Lens 
  well, if you recording time lapse of the moon....and your phone couldn't zoom so far away... This zoom lens is suitable for you! It's cheap, easy to carry and also can zoom 18x far away! 
 *But mostly I use it to take picture of far-away object, plants or moon, I didn't use it to record time lapse*
 

 3. Mini Tripod 
  many people shall have this.... especially photographers... It can hold your phone, and you can record the video with less shaking, or you can use it to record a vlogs...
 

 4. Videography Stick/Handheld Stabilizer/Selfie Stick
  this is actually selfie stick, but I can also become a handheld Stabilizer while recording video. But it just perform descent, not as good as a Gimbal Stabilizer...",,

 What they overlook, is that you get the video feed and then it puts the likes of waveforms etc. underneath, without taking anything away from your video feed.
 

 I find that handy.",,

333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:18:59.1150000+01:00,Those are the same price as a remus And 23x bigger,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:19:02.4150000+01:00,They are nice tho,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:19:15.9520000+01:00,"But they are huge , NEED LENS SUPPORT",,
221879800900354048,ntannoy,2025-04-21T12:19:34.8360000+01:00,"Oh, the size isn't that much of a problem, it's for my A cam so I already have a huge ass case for it and a lens support",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:19:44.6850000+01:00,And the flare is also not taking up the color that the source is,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:20:02.4670000+01:00,While on the remus u have the option to get natural flares,,
221879800900354048,ntannoy,2025-04-21T12:20:02.8800000+01:00,"Yeah I'm aware, but finding used neutral lenses is pretty difficult",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:20:20.2760000+01:00,I mean try it and see how u like it,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:20:26.2170000+01:00,They are decent tho,,
221879800900354048,ntannoy,2025-04-21T12:20:30.9820000+01:00,"Yeah, but I didn't buy it from the BLAZAR website since B&H usually sells it cheaper, but yeah I'm excited man",,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:21:04.0990000+01:00,B&H is the way to go,,
221879800900354048,ntannoy,2025-04-21T12:21:16.3260000+01:00,The only thing I'm a bit worried about is if it has like super over the top extreme lens flares which it might since it's 1.8x but since it's an A cam I think I can control the lighting a bit more to remove a bit of that,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:21:19.4680000+01:00,How about the Remus is it more expensive there ?,,
221879800900354048,ntannoy,2025-04-21T12:21:28.8610000+01:00,Let me check,,
333909848762744832,potiii,2025-04-21T12:21:41.1500000+01:00,So the Remus has very nice subtle flares that‚Äôs why iv chose it,,
221879800900354048,ntannoy,2025-04-21T12:23:06.8120000+01:00,"Yeah, the Remus is about $100 more, but actually it's more like $200-$300 since I'd probably have to get a PL to EF adapter for it, but it's alright",,
221879800900354048,ntannoy,2025-04-21T12:23:38.5700000+01:00,"Another reason I got blue streaks, is I got a Sirui for my B cam, but for some reason they only make lenses with blue streaks, so to match the footage I wanted to get the same streak color for both cameras",,
221879800900354048,ntannoy,2025-04-21T12:23:54.2260000+01:00,but this time I got an actual prime instead of a shitty little adapter,,
221879800900354048,ntannoy,2025-04-21T12:24:50.5260000+01:00,"otherwise I'd probably get amber or neutral, but I actually do quite like amber",,
